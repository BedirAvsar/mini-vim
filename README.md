# Mini-Vim (Kilo-style Text Editor)

A terminal-based text editor written in pure C without using ncurses.
This project focuses on low-level terminal handling, raw mode input,
ANSI escape sequences, and manual memory management.

## Goals
- Understand how terminal input works at a low level
- Learn pointer-heavy text manipulation
- Gain confidence with C and Linux/macOS internals

## Tech Stack
- C
- POSIX (termios, unistd)
- ANSI escape sequences

## Status
 In progress
